    "content": "[Page 1] Poisonous Food s While cats don’t beg the same way a dog does, they still can make it clear that they would like a little taste of what we’re eating. Most of the time that is not a good idea. Cats have sensitive digestive systems and if they ea t something they shouldn’t, you will soon see it again. It is better not to give them any of your meal. Some foods are outright poisonous too, such as:  Alcoholic beverages  Apricot and peach pits  Avocado  Cherries - fruit, stones and leaves  Chocolate - all forms  Coffee - all forms  Garlic - all forms  Macadamia nuts  Moldy or spoiled foods  Mushrooms  Onions or onion powder  Products sweetened with xylitol  Raisins and grapes  Salt  Raw potatoes  Yeast dough In addition, ham and pork products, including hot dogs, sausages, lunch meat, bacon or pork chops contain fat globules too big for a cat’s veins and can clog the blood vessels quickly",
